# Student-Retention-Analysis
Analysis students' data and predict who will drop out


This is a course project, and groups will be ranked on Kaggle. Our prediction result ranked 2nd out of 6 groups.

The main file of analyzing is written in qmd. We've tried 2 ways of feature engineering because we cannot get a satisfying result through the first way.

The models we've tried include Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, KNN, LDA, Logistic, SVM, Bagging, Ranger. And Ranger seemed to be the best.
